# agent-shell-macext

macOS-specific enhancements for [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell).

## Features

### Enhanced `C-y` (yank)

Pressing `C-y` in an agent-shell buffer is context-aware on macOS:

- **Files copied from Finder** — inserts them as `@file` references. Images are shown as inline previews; other files appear as clickable links.
- **Clipboard text that is a file path** — same as above.
- **Raw image data on clipboard** — falls back to agent-shell's built-in handler.
- **Anything else** — normal yank.

### Drag and drop

Dragging files from Finder (or any app) into an agent-shell buffer works identically to `C-y`.

### Native notifications

agent-shell-macext posts native macOS notifications for key agent events:

- **Turn complete** — when the agent finishes a turn, with a human-readable reason (Finished, Cancelled, Reached max token limit, etc.).
- **Permission required** — when the agent is waiting for your approval.

Notifications are smart about when to fire:

| Situation | Notifies |
|---|---|
| Emacs not focused (in background) | Always |
| Emacs focused, different buffer active | Always |
| Emacs focused, agent-shell buffer or its viewport buffer is current | Only if `agent-shell-macext-notify-current-buffer` is non-nil (default `nil`) |

`agent-shell-macext-notify-current-buffer` can be set buffer-locally to control behaviour per session:

```elisp
(setq-local agent-shell-macext-notify-current-buffer t)
```

### Smart file copy policy

Files referenced from outside the project directory may not be readable by the agent due to macOS permissions. `agent-shell-macext` handles this transparently.

Controlled by `agent-shell-macext-file-copy-policy`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Copy files that are outside the project to `.agent-shell/.macext/`. Skip copying if the agent has blanket permissions (e.g. `agent-shell-permission-allow-always`) or if the file is already inside the project. |
| `always-copy` | Always copy every file to `.agent-shell/.macext/`. |
| `always-original` | Always use the original path as-is. |

Regardless of the policy, files in system temporary directories (`/var/folders/`, `/tmp/`, `/private/tmp/`) are **always copied**. These paths — such as screenshots dragged from the iOS Simulator — can be deleted by macOS at any time, so keeping the original path would cause a "file does not exist" error.

## Requirements

- Emacs 29.1+
- [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) 0.48.1+
- macOS (NS window system)
- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) (recommended, for pop-out notifications)

  ```bash
  brew install terminal-notifier
  ```

  Without it, notifications are sent via `osascript` and will only appear in the notification panel unless you set the alert style for Script Editor to **Banners** or **Alerts** in System Settings → Notifications.

## Installation

### package-vc (Emacs 29+)

```elisp
(use-package agent-shell-macext
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/cxa/agent-shell-macext")
  :hook (agent-shell-mode . agent-shell-macext-setup)
  :custom
  (agent-shell-macext-file-copy-policy 'auto)    ; auto, always-copy, always-original
  (agent-shell-macext-notifications t)           ; enable native notifications
  (agent-shell-macext-notify-current-buffer nil)) ; nil = suppress when shell/viewport is current and Emacs is focused
```

### Manual

Clone this repo and add it to your load path:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/agent-shell-macext")
(require 'agent-shell-macext)
(setq agent-shell-macext-file-copy-policy 'auto)    ; auto, always-copy, always-original
(setq agent-shell-macext-notifications t)           ; enable native notifications
(setq agent-shell-macext-notify-current-buffer nil) ; nil = suppress when shell/viewport is current and Emacs is focused
(add-hook 'agent-shell-mode-hook #'agent-shell-macext-setup)
```
